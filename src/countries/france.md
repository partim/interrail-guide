someone provide details?]_

## Reservations

### TGV and Intercité

Pass reservations are mandatory for all TGV services. They are also
mandatory for Intercité trains on the following routes:

* Paris – Limoges – Toulouse,
* Paris – Clermont-Ferrand,
* Bordeaux – Marseille.

Intercité de nuit services also require reservations, see below. All
other Intercité do not require a reservation but a seat can be reserved.

Mandatory pass reservations are available in two categories. They cost the
same in either class. A limited number of seats is available for 10 EUR
after which 20 EUR are charged. Pass reservations are limited. Paid
tickets may still be available on a train when pass reservations are sold
out.

Reservations can be purchased online from

* [Belgian Railways
  SNCB](https://travel.b-europe.com/eurail-ge/en/booking-tgv#TravelWish)
  for TGV trains only (!) with a booking fee of 4 euros. You don’t need an
  account but you do need your pass cover number. For mobile passes, you
  can [generate a cover number
  online](https://www.eurail.com/en/book-reservations#/generatePassCoverNumber).
* [Interrail](https://www.interrail.eu/en/book-reservations#/) at
  a surcharge of 2 euros per reservation. You need an account and have to
  register your pass.
* [Trainplanet](https://trainplanet.com/) sells reservations for TGVs and
  Intercities at what looks like a 10% surcharge. Don’t forget to switch
  the currency to euros! You need a pass cover number.

Reservations can also be bought from Grand Lignes ticket machines and
SNCF booking offices.

Note that it seems that the online services occasionally have differing
prices and availability for the same train. So it may also be that those
differ with machines and booking offices (domestic and abroad) again.


### TER

Reservations for TER services are mandatory on TER trains between Paris
and the Normandy region, dubbed ‘Krono’ and ‘Krono+’, on these routes:

* Paris – Caen – Cherbourg,
* Paris – Trouville/Deauville,
* Paris – Argentan – Granville,
* Paris – Rouen – Le Havre,
* Paris – Dieppe (direct weekend services).

These reservations are _only_ available from _Grand Lignes_ ticket machines 
and SNCF booking offices at a price of EUR 1,70.


### Intercité de Nuit

Pass reservations are mandatory in Intercité de nuit overnight services.

These trains provide seating accommodation and couchettes. If you have a
second class pass, you get a six bunk couchette, while for first class
compartments with four bunks are provided.

Reservations for couchettes can be purchased online from
[Trainplanet](https://trainplanet.com/) for EUR 23,80.
