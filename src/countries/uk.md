## Reservations

### Day Trains

Reservations are not mandatory for day trains despite information provided
otherwise. This has been confirmed by booking office and on-board staff.

If you still want one, reservations can be acquired online free of charge
from

* [GWR](https://www.gwr.com/) for all train operators. You
  need to register an account and can then make reservations from the ‘My
  Bookings’ section,
* [LNER](https://www.lner.co.uk/travel-information/make-a-reservation/)
  for LNER trains only.

You can also get seat reservations free of charge from any booking office.

### Sleeper Services

Standard reservations are necessary for the Caledonian Sleeper and GWR’s
Night Rivera.

For the Caledonian Sleeper, reservations for sleeper cabins can be bought
from their website, [sleeper.scot](https://www.sleeper.scot). Tick ‘room
supplement only’ at the bottom of the ‘more options’ box. Prices are GBP
130 for a standard cabin, GBP 180 for en-suite. _[I couldn’t get prices
for a double cabin while trying. Maybe they aren’t sold as supplement
only?]_

Reservations for seats are free and aren’t sold online.

Reservations for the Night Rivera cannot be made online.
