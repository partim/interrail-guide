Passes are valid on ÖBB and DB Eurocity and Railjet services.

Passes are _not_ valid on Italo services.

Passes are _not_ valid on any other local or regional railway company.


## Timetables

Timetables of the regional railway companies (on which Interrail is not
valid) may not be included in the Railplanner app or other planning sites.
They are, however, included in [Trenitalia’s travel
planner](https://www.trenitalia.com/) and their apps.


## Reservations

### Le Frecce and Intercity

Pass reservations are mandatory for all Trenitalia long distance services,
i.e., Frecciarosso, Frecciargento, Frecciabianca, and Intercity.

These cost EUR 3 for Intercity and EUR 10 for le Frecce.

For overnight services, see below.

Reservations can be purchased online from

* [ÖBB](https://shop.oebbtickets.at) without a surcharge. Change
  the discount for traveller to ‘Interrail / Eurail - Globalpass’ and
  select ‘one-way tickets and day tickets.’ You do not need an account.
* [Interrail](https://www.interrail.eu/en/book-reservations#/) at
  a surcharge of 2 euros per reservation. You need an account and have to
  register your pass.
* [Trainplanet](https://trainplanet.com/) sells reservations for TGVs and
  Intercities at what looks like a 10% surcharge. Don’t forget to switch
  the currency to euros! You need a pass cover number.

Reservations can be purchased from booking offices at Italian stations.
They are _not_ available from ticket machines.
