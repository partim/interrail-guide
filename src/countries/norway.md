## Reservations

Reservations are now mandatory on all long-distance services. The
only exceptions are the Oslo to Gjøvik and Oslo to Gøteborg routes as well
as all suburban trains.

Seat reservations are free for first class passes and cost NOK 50 (about
EUR 4,50) for second class passes. On overnight services, reclining chairs
are available for NOK 600 (about EUR 50) as well as sleeper compartments
for up to two people for NOK 1100 (about EUR 95).

Reservations can now be purchased online from the Norwegian booking
agency [Entur](https://entur.no). In the traveller selection there you can
select one (and only one) Interrail/Eurail traveller. Don’t forget to
remove the normal adult. If you need more than one reservation, you either
have to call the number provided or just do multiple separate
reservations. You can choose a seat on the seat map, so this should be
fine. The connection selection view will still show normal prices. Don’t
worry about that, the correct prices are shown once you select a connection.

Reservations can also be booked at Entur booking office in Bergen, Stavanger,
Trondheim, Oslo, and Olso airport.
