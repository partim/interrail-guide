# Norway

## Validity

Passes are valid on all regular train services with the following
exceptions:

* Passes are _not_ valid on Flåmsbana.
* Passes are _not_ valid on Flytoget airport express trains in Oslo.


## Reservations

Reservations are now mandatory on all long-distance services. The
only exceptions are the Oslo to Gjøvik and Oslo to Gøteborg routes as well
as all suburban trains.

Seat reservations are free for first class passes and cost NOK 50 (roughly
EUR 4,40) for second class passes. On overnight services, reclining chairs
and sleeper compartments are also available. The latter are NOK 1000
(around EUR 88).

Until recently, reservations could not be purchased online or on ticket
machines. You have to either call [Entur](https://entur.no), the organization
that sells railway tickets in Norway, at [+47 61 27 90 88](tel:+4761279088)
or go to one of their ticket offices, available in Bergen, Stavanger,
Trondheim, Oslo, and Olso airport.

It now appears that they can now be purchased only from

* [Interrail](https://www.interrail.eu/en/book-reservations#/) at
  a surcharge of 2 euros per reservation. You need an account and have to
  register your pass.
* [Trainplanet](https://trainplanet.com/) for EUR 4,40 for most trains,
  but some trains shown with a price of EUR 25.80. Free reservations for
  first class pass holders do not seem to be available nor sleeper
  compartment reservations.

Caveat: We haven’t yet checked whether these go actually through and
whether Trainplanet wants to mail you a paper ticket. If you try these
services, we’d love to hear from you!
