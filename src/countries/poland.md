## Validity

Passes are valid on trains operated by the following companies:

* PKP Intercity (most long distance trains),
* PKP SKM w Trójmieście (suburban services in the Gdansk region),
* Polregio,
* Koleje Dolnośląskie.

Passes are _not_ valid on local services operated by any other company.

## Reservations

Standard reservations are mandatory for all _[most?]_ PKP Intercity trains
(that’s the company, not the train type), i.e., all long distance trains. 

Reservations can be purchased online from

* [PKP Intercity](https://www.intercity.pl/en/) at a cost of 1 PLN per
  person and train (about 0.20 euros). You need an account.
  Interrail/Eurail discount is only available for direct connections.
  Thus, you need to book every train separately. Cross border services are
  not available.
* [Czech railways ČD](https://www.cd.cz/) at a cost of 73 CZK per
  person and train (about 3 euros) for IC and TLK trains. They cannot sell
  reservations for EIP trains. You need an account. Cross-border
  services into Czechia are also available. Cross-border services into
  Germany are not.
* [Trainplanet](https://trainplanet.com/) sells reservations for all trains,
  including cross border services into Czechia and Germany. IC and TLK
  services cost 5 euros, EIP services 11 euros. Don’t forget to switch
  the currency to euros! You need a pass cover number.
* [Interrail](https://www.interrail.eu/en/book-reservations#/) but
  only as paper tickets with a lead time of 6 days.

Reservations can be purchased from Polish booking offices at no cost.
