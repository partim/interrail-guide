# Introduction

Interrail and Eurail passes promise unlimited, easy rail travel through
Europe. But various countries and railway companies prefer to make using
the passes rather more complicated by limiting where they are accepted
and requiring reservations when they are.

This site tries to collect information on validity of Interrail and Eurail
passes and provide guidance on where to purchase mandatory reservations.

The site is organized into three parts. The first part contains country
guides for each participating country. These guides generally only cover
domestic services but will point to the relevant sections for
cross-border. Those cross border services are covered in the second part.
The third part provides a summary and some tips and tricks for online
services that sell reservations.



## Terminology

### Passes

Since the only real difference for Interrail and Eurail
passes is who can purchase them, we will simplify matters and from here on
use the term _pass_ to mean both Interrail and Eurail passes – unless
explicitly mentioned otherwise.

For both systems, there are _global passes_ which cover all participating
countries, and _one country passes_ which cover only one country or, in
case of the Benelux pass, three.

You can use one country passes for domestic trains within their country
only. This does, however, usually include cross-border trains where
passes are valid as long as you stay within the country.


### Standard Reservations v. Pass Reservations

The term _reservation_ means you have acquired some sort of explicit access
certificate for a specific train up front rather than just rolling up on the
station a couple minutes prior to departure. Typically such a reservation
includes dedicated seat allocations.

We will use the term _standard reservation_ when a reservation is not
specifically made for a pass but can be used with any ticket.
In contrast, we will refer to reservations that are specifically for use
with an pass an _pass reservation._ The latter typically
include some sort of surcharge which can range from a few euros to fifty
or so euros for a seat.

This distinction is important when purchasing reservations. For standard
reservations, you can normally just use the railway companies regular
website and choose a ‘seat reservation only’ option. For pass
reservations, you often need to pretend to buy a regular ticket and add
your pass as a discount card or, more often than not, need to use some
special service.

While we do appreciate the effort, it is just easier for retaining style
